At the end of the day, if you think about it, the product of a life is an obituary. Perhaps, Paul Graham is right when he said doing things you know won't end up in your obituary is a waste of time. I just want to be intellectually honest, cynical, and do impressive things that matter as measured by some objective standards. I am afraid sometimes, but I guess that's okay. I'm just a clueless curious little kid trying to walk through the fluctuating surface of a massive search space. I might not even get there, but to die trying is better than to die without purpose :)
