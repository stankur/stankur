### Wudupzz World!

---

My real name is Stanley Kurniawan, but my family and friends call me: 

- Stanley
- Stankur
- Bebek (which means duck in Indonesian cuz I look like a duck in real life lmao)
- Botak (which means bald in Indonesia cuz I cut my hair real short so that I could extend the time to the next haircut)
- Yubun
- Kurkur
- kur

Don't hesitate to invent a new way to call me and I'll add new ones to the list! It makes me feel like a Russian spy ðŸ˜Ž

"Fun" facts about me:

- I am lactose intolerant
- I like milk
- I love exploring new things
- I love trying hard to achieve one thing at a time
- I have more screen time than socializing time
- Single (because of the previous point)
